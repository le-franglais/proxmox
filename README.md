# Proxmox

When it comes to enterprise virtualisation, there are so many options.  My personal favorite, however, is Proxmox.  

## Description
Proxmox is an open-source, Debian-based Type 1 hypervisor able to scale for enterprise deployments at a fraction of the cost of other options like Citrix XenServer or VMWare vSphere ESXi.  Not denigrating either of the other two options -- just highlighting my preference for Proxmox. 

I've been meaning to make a post about Proxmox for a long time, and I've just not taken the time to get notes and screenshots down on paper and make it presentable ; consider that item checked off the list.  I've created a Proxmox installation walkthrough as well as a quick tutorial on some of it's functionality.
